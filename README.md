# HackThisBoxCTF

Description:
The goal is to ssh into 2 different machines and find the flags! All of the tools you need are related to finding files and changing permissions. 

Hints:
1. How do you see files?
2. How can you change permissions?
3. Is there anything hidden?
4. How do I ssh into another machine?

Course Concepts:

The course has taught us linux commands and why they are so powerful. Going through this ctf, this should be a reminder of the linux commands. As well, we have learned how to access different machines via ssh. There are security risks of why it shouldn't be easy to access different machines on a network.
